I am doing this project as a part of The Odin Project's Curriculum.

The main aim of this webpage is to understand the concepts of HTML, CSS by trying to build a page. 
So, here <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google homepage</a> was deconstructed and I made a look alike.
This was very time consuming for me but, I nice start to build webpages.
