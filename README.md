I am doing this project as a part of The Odin Project's Curriculum.

The main aim of this webpage is to understand the concepts of HTML and CSS by trying to build a webpage. 
So, here <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google homepage</a> was deconstructed by me from which I made a look alike.
It was very time consuming but, a nice start to building webpages.
